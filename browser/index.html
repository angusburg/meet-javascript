<!--
  HTML files determine how a webpage looks like in the browser structurally.
  You can define elements using the <thingy></thingy> syntax.

  The 'head' section of an HTML file lets you add some metadata about the page
  you're writing.
  
  In this file, we got a 'title' element, which changes the text of the tab the
  page is opened in. The 'link' element has a few more pieces of information.
  In this one, it is loading a stylesheet into the page.

  We're just going to quickly gloss over the stylesheet and what's in the file,
  but basically it determines how the page elements looks stylistically.
-->
<head>
  <title>Meet JavaScript</title>
  
  <!-- Remove the comment to use the stylesheet! -->
  <!-- <link href="index.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    'div' stands for document division. Basically it lets you mark up a section
    in HTML so you can refer to it in your stylesheets or in your scripts. It
    does nothing on its own.

    'h1' and 'h2' are two of the six header elements. They're used for bigger
    text.
    'p' is a paragraph element. They're used for paragraphs of text.
    'a' is a clickable link element that lets you specify another page.
    'input' is an input element.
    'button' is a clickable button.

    You can see how there's a bunch of other stuff like 'id', 'class', 'type',
    'href', 'src', etc. sprinkled around the elements. These are attributes of
    the element. Some elements like the 'script' and 'a' elements require
    special attribute to get them to work, but all elements can be given a
    'class' or 'id' attribute.

    You can refer to specific elements you've given an 'id' or 'class' through
    your script. To keep things simple we'll deal with 'id's only for now.

    'script' is a script element. You can either load in an external script file
    like we've done here, or directly put JavaScript right in the
