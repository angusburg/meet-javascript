# Meet JavaScript
An introduction to JavaScript by Angus Lam <anguslam@buffalo.edu> (http://angus.works)

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language critical to how the web works today. JavaScript is most commonly used to make websites dynamic, but can also be used on web servers, making games, and even scripting for repetitive tasks for creative applications like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. It is by far the most popular language (measured by GitHub pull requests).

If you're interested in web development, there's no escaping from JavaScript for the near future. It's an immensely versatile language that provides a lot of utility, supported by a massive community of developers.

## Workshop
### Prereqs
You'll need a few things for this workshop
* Very basic programming experience
* A computer with internet connection
* A text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Part 1: In-browser REPL
We're going to use a JavaScript [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) so you can get started quickly. We'll be using https://repl.it/languages/javascript. Go ahead and open up the browser and it should look something like this.

### Part 2: Browser
We'll be using a simple website set up from within the repository. You can either download this repository or clone the repo to your computer.

Open the files in your text editor, then go to the `browser/` folder and open the `index.html` file in your browser. You should see something like this.
